        To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net.<br> A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.</p>
